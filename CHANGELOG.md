* Improve automatic re-connecting when using the high-level MailClient API.
* Support timeouts for IMAP, SMTP and POP calls.
* `MimeMessage`:
  - Get an alternative mime part easier with  `MimePart? getAlternativePart(MediaSubtype subtype)`.
  - Retrieve all recipients via the `List<MailAddress> get recipients` getter.
  - Support decoding `binary` transfer-encoding for text message parts.
